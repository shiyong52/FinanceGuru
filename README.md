#### Description: My final projects allows you to keep track of your expenses, income, asset, and liabilities. At the same time, you can also set your target to save for each month and see whether you met your target.
This web app gives an overview of your spending and makes you more aware of it in a month/week by manually typing it and understanding where your money is spent.
## Introduction

## Features

## Design Choices

In designing Finance Guru, I aimed for a user-friendly and accessible platform. The choice of React for the front-end allows for seamless component-based development and smooth user interactions. On the back-end, I opted for Express as it offers an efficient framework for handling server-side logic and API integrations.

To ensure scalability and real-time data updates, I decided to use MongoDB as the database. Its flexibility and NoSQL nature fit well with the dynamic requirements of financial data.

For the graph visualization, I selected Chart.js for its simplicity and adaptability. This library allows users to grasp complex spending patterns effortlessly.
