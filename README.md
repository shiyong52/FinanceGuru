## Introduction

## Introduction

Finance Guru is a comprehensive web application that aims to revolutionize financial management for individuals and businesses alike. As my Harvard CS50 final project, I set out to create a powerful yet user-friendly tool that enables users to take control of their finances, plan for the future, and make informed decisions. Hailing from the dynamic city of [Your City, Your Country], I'm proud to present this advanced web app to the world.

## Features

### Expense Tracking

At the core of Finance Guru lies the Expense Tracking feature. Leveraging React, I designed an intuitive and responsive UI that allows users to effortlessly log and categorize their daily expenses. Every expense is meticulously stored in a MongoDB database, granting users a clear view of their spending habits. Armed with this information, users can make data-driven budgeting decisions and identify areas where they can cut costs to achieve financial goals.

### Income Management

Finance Guru's Income Management feature offers real-time insights into various income streams. Using the Express framework, I implemented a robust back-end system to handle diverse income sources, including regular paychecks, freelancing gigs, and investment returns. This integration ensures seamless data processing, empowering users to stay on top of their financial inflows, create better income allocation strategies, and optimize their overall financial stability.

### Asset & Liabilities

To provide users with a comprehensive financial overview, I developed the Asset & Liabilities management module. Employing advanced algorithms, this feature monitors the valuation of assets, including investments, properties, and other financial holdings. Simultaneously, it keeps vigilant track of outstanding debts and liabilities. This holistic approach enables users to assess their net worth accurately and make informed decisions about their financial health and investment choices.

### Monthly Savings Target

Setting financial goals is essential for every individual, and with Finance Guru's Monthly Savings Target feature, users can do just that. By harnessing intelligent forecasting models, users can set personalized monthly savings goals tailored to their specific needs. The user interface dynamically updates to display the progress towards these goals, motivating users to stay disciplined and accountable.

### Monthly Expenses Graph

The pièce de résistance of Finance Guru is undoubtedly the Monthly Expenses Graph. Using the powerful Chart.js library, I crafted an interactive and visually engaging graph that displays users' spending patterns over time. This graph enables users to gain deep insights into their financial behavior, identify trends, and discover opportunities for optimizing their expenses.

## Design Choices

Throughout the development process, I made several design choices to ensure the user experience was smooth and effective. By using React for the front-end, I adopted a component-based approach, allowing for modular development and easy maintenance. This decision proved critical in creating a responsive and dynamic user interface that adapts seamlessly to various devices.

For the back-end, I opted for the Express framework due to its efficiency in handling server-side logic and APIs. This decision allowed Finance Guru to process data quickly and efficiently, ensuring real-time updates and a seamless user experience.

To store financial data securely and ensure scalability, I chose MongoDB as the database. Its NoSQL nature and flexibility enable easy storage and retrieval of complex financial data structures.
